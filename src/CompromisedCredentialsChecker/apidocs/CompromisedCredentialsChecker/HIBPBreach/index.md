| [AddedDate](properties/AddedDate.md)                   | The date and time (precision to the minute) the breach was added to the system in ISO 8601 format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [BreachDate](properties/BreachDate.md)                 | The date (with no time) the breach originally occurred on in ISO 8601 format. This is not always accurate — frequently breaches are discovered and reported long after the original incident. Use this attribute as a guide only.                                                                                                                                           |
| [DataClasses](properties/DataClasses.md)               | This attribute describes the nature of the data compromised in the breach and contains an alphabetically ordered string array of impacted data classes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [Description](properties/Description.md)               | Contains an overview of the breach represented in HTML markup. The description may include markup such as emphasis and strong tags as well as hyperlinks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [Domain](properties/Domain.md)                         | The domain of the primary website the breach occurred on. This may be used for identifying other assets external systems may have for the site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [IsFabricated](properties/IsFabricated.md)             | Indicates that the breach is considered unverified. An unverified breach may not have been hacked from the indicated website. An unverified breach is still loaded into HIBP when there's sufficient confidence that a significant portion of the data is legitimate.                                                                                                       |
| [IsMalware](properties/IsMalware.md)                   | Indicates if the breach is sourced from malware. This flag has no impact on any other attributes, it merely flags that the data was sourced from a malware campaign rather than a security compromise of an online service.                                                                                                                                                 |
| [IsRetired](properties/IsRetired.md)                   | Indicates if the breach has been retired. This data has been permanently removed and will not be returned by the API.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [IsSensitive](properties/IsSensitive.md)               | Indicates if the breach is considered sensitive. The public API will not return any accounts for a breach flagged as sensitive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [IsSpamList](properties/IsSpamList.md)                 | Indicates if the breach has been retired. This data has been permanently removed and will not be returned by the API.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [IsSubscriptionFree](properties/IsSubscriptionFree.md) | Indicates if the breach is subscription free. This flag has no impact on any other attributes, it is only used when running a domain search where a sufficiently sized subscription isn't present.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [IsVerified](properties/IsVerified.md)                 | Indicates that the breach is considered unverified. An unverified breach may not have been hacked from the indicated website. An unverified breach is still loaded into HIBP when there's sufficient confidence that a significant portion of the data is legitimate.                                                                                                       |
| [LogoPath](properties/LogoPath.md)                     | A URI that specifies where a logo for the breached service can be found. Logos are always in PNG format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [ModifiedDate](properties/ModifiedDate.md)             | The date and time (precision to the minute) the breach was modified in ISO 8601 format. This will only differ from the AddedDate attribute if other attributes represented here are changed or data in the breach itself is changed (i.e. additional data is identified and loaded). It is always either equal to or greater then the AddedDate attribute, never less than. |
| [Name](properties/Name.md)                             | A Pascal\-cased name representing the breach which is unique across all other breaches. This value never changes and may be used to name dependent assets (such as images) but should not be shown directly to end users (see the "Title" attribute instead).                                                                                                               |
| [PwnCount](properties/PwnCount.md)                     | The total number of accounts loaded into the system. This is usually less than the total number reported by the media due to duplication or other data integrity issues in the source data.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [Title](properties/Title.md)                           | A descriptive title for the breach suitable for displaying to end users. It's unique across all breaches but individual values may change in the future (i.e. if another breach occurs against an organisation already in the system). If a stable value is required to reference the breach, refer to the "Name" attribute instead.                                        |
