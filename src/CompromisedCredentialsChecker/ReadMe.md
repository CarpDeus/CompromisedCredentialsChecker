# CompromisedCredentialsChecker
NuGet Package for easily implementing the [HaveIBeenPwned V3 API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3) current as of 2024-Mar-03
I have sample code implementing it at [Demo Code](https://github.com/CarpDeus/CompromisedCredentialsConsoleDemo)
The full [API documentation](src/CompromisedCredentialsChecker/apidocs/CompromisedCredentialsChecker/index.md) is here.

To use the API you will need to have an API Key. You can purchase as subscription [here](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/Key).

While all of the API works, I'm going to try to improve on it over the coming weeks. [Feedback](https://github.com/CarpDeus/CompromisedCredentialsChecker/discussions) is always welcome.
